## Input Calculator

### Description

Write a method called <b>inputThenPrintSumAndAverage</b> that does not have any parameters. The method should not return anything (<b>void</b>) and it needs to keep reading int numbers from the keyboard. When the user enters something that is not an int then it needs to print a message in the format "SUM = XX AVG = YY".

XX represents the sum of all entered numbers of type <b>int</b>.<br>
YY represents the calculated average of all numbers of type <b>long</b>.

<b>TIP</b>: Use casting when calling the <b>round</b> method since it needs <b>double</b> as a parameter.
